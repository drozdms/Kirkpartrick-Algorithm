## Kirkpatrick algorithm for efficient search of a point inside a simple polygon

This is a **Point Location Algorithm**. Given a polygon on a plane, an answer should be given for any point located on the plane, whether it lies inside the polygon or not.

Krkpatrick's algorithm works in *O*(log*n*) time and requires *O*(*n*) of memory, where *n* is the number of vertices on the polygon.

A good description of how the algorithm works can be found [here](https://www.ics.uci.edu/~goodrich/teach/geom/notes/Kirkpatrick.pdf "Michael Goodrich. Kirkpatrickâ€™s Point Location Algorithm").
